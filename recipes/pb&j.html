    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The PB&J is as American as it gets, and its story is spread across the internet from web page to web page as if by digital butter knife, each as recognizable to the next as the sandwich itself. I'll spare you too much of a regurgitation here, except in the broadest strokes: It supposedly started as a fancy-ish tea sandwich at the turn of the 20th century, but quickly became a popular lunchtime snack as an increasingly industrialized food system made sliced bread and store-bought jam and peanut butter a common and affordable option to Americans of all economic stripes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices bread</li>
        <li>jam/jelly of your choice</li>
        <li>Peanut butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>spread peanut butter on one slice of toast</li>
        <li>spread jam on the other slice of toast</li>
        <li>stack the two piecs of bread together so that they face eachother.</li>
    </ol>
