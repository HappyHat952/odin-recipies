    <h1>Omurice</h1>
    <a href = "../index.html">Back to Home</a>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This Western-style dish is unique to Japan, as it doesnâ€™t exist in American or European cuisine. Several restaurants in Japan claim to have created omurice in the early 1900s. However, it was in 1925 that a chef in Osaka at a Western-style diner called Hokkyokusei created a dish very similar to the omurice that we know and love today.</p>
